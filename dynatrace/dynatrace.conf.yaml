# This file is used by the Dynatrace service to send events 
# (Deployment, Test Start/Stop, Quality Gates result) to entities in Dynatrace
# It is possible to use the following placeholders:
#   $SERVICE, $PROJECT, $STAGE
#   $LABEL.[labelname]: any label that was added to the deployment-finished or start-evaluation events
# More info: https://github.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service
