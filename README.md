# quality-gates-samples
A repository with Quality Gates sample configuration files

You can use these as a reference for implementing Quality Gates.

Each subfolder (dynatrace, monaco, shipyard, sli, slo) contains sample configuration files.

In the bundles directory, you will find use-case specific examples containing all the configurations.

> Note: these samples often cannot be used as-is and will need tailoring to the specific environments
